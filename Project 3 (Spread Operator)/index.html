Is this the best way to transfer properties?

Using the spread operator to transfer properties is convenient, 
and it’s a marked improvement over explicitly defining each
 property at each component as we were originally doing. 
 The thing is, even the spread operator approach isn’t a
  perfect solution. If all you want to do is transfer a 
  property to a particular component, having each intermediate
   component play a role in passing it on is unnecessary. 
   Worse, it has the potential to be a performance bottleneck.
    Any change to a property that you are passing along will
     trigger a component update on each component along the 
     property’s path. That’s not a good thing! Later, 
     we look at ways to solve this transferring properties
      problem in a much better, without any side effects.
